\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs22\lang20 Thank you for installing Wot Numbers version 1.0.14\par
This version is simplified compared to previous versions. The online statisctics and forum pages has been discontinued, so no data is uploaded to web. This makes the application a bit faster though.\par
The web site is also simplified, but you can still find it here:\par
