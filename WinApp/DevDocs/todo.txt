Unify log files:
Currently there are 2 log.txt files. Initially it's purpose was to keep an internal log file 
with more technical info for developers, and another more generic and feature based for the users.
After updating the application once a month it looks a bit confusing why there are those 2, so better
to unify them even including some technical information there like "added a new Column in the Batte 
Table in the SQL database" which at first glance may look uninteresting for the general user.
